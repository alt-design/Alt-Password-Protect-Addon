# Alt Password Protect

> Secure your Statamic entries with user-friendly, individualized password protection

## Features

- Choose which entries to password protect
- Choose individual password for each entry
- Choose default password for all selected entries
- Hide password protected entries from collection listings, and then override if needed
- Extends, but doesn't affect, existing Statamic password protection

## How to Install

You can search for this addon in the `Tools > Addons` section of the Statamic control panel and click **install**, or run the following command from your project root:

``` bash
composer require alt-design/alt-password-protect
```

## How to Use

The Addon adds another tab onto entries, which allows you to select whether you want default password protection, a custom password, or none. You can set the default site password by going to `Alt Password Protect` in the control panel.

There's also the ability to remove the password protected items from collections, so that they don't show up in the collection listing. This is useful if you want to have a collection of password protected items, but don't want to show them in the collection listing. You can also tweak this setting in the settings (ofc).

You can then also override the hide using `alt_protect_ignore="true"` on your collection tag.
